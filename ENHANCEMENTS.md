# YouTube Transcript API Enhancements

## Summary of Changes

1. **Fixed Indentation Issues**:

   - Corrected indentation in FastAPI endpoints
   - Fixed server startup code formatting
   - Ensured consistent formatting throughout codebase

2. **Enhanced Retry Logic**:

   - Added retry mechanism to handle intermittent "no element found" errors
   - Implemented retry count parameter (configurable, default: 2 retries after first attempt)
   - Added delay between retries for better reliability

3. **API Endpoints Improvements**:

   - Enhanced `/transcript` endpoint to support both full and text-only formats
   - Updated batch processing endpoint to use the utility function with retry support
   - Added proper error handling across all endpoints

4. **Documentation**:

   - Updated README.md with new endpoint information
   - Added examples for text-only transcript retrieval
   - Documented retry mechanism and error handling

5. **Testing**:
   - Created test scripts to verify retry logic
   - Added API endpoint tests
   - Confirmed all features working as expected

## Files Modified

1. `fastapi_server.py` - Fixed indentation issues, improved endpoint implementation
2. `async_transcript_service.py` - Added retry logic in `get_transcript_async` method
3. `transcript_utils.py` - Utility functions for batch processing with retry support
4. `README.md` - Updated documentation
5. `requirements.txt` - Added new dependencies for testing

## New Features

1. **Query Parameter Support**:

   - `/transcript?video_id=ID&language=en` instead of `/transcript/ID`
   - Better aligned with REST API standards

2. **Text-Only Transcript**:

   - Added `format=text` parameter option
   - Implemented dedicated `/transcript/text` endpoint
   - Returns only the transcript text without timing information

3. **Automatic Retry**:
   - Handles transient "no element found" errors
   - Especially useful for first-time requests that often fail
   - Configurable retry count (default: 2)

## Testing

1. **Single Video Test**:

   - Verified retry logic works
   - Confirmed both successful and error cases are handled

2. **Batch Processing Test**:

   - Tested multiple videos simultaneously
   - Confirmed retry logic applied to each video independently

3. **API Endpoint Tests**:
   - Tested all endpoints (GET, POST)
   - Verified both full and text-only formats
   - Confirmed batch processing works correctly
